for a $T$ with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .

for desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse ( interesting but not extraordinary ) and $T$ , which was phenomenal .
matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake

maybe it was the great company ( i had friends visiting from philly – yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but i just ca n’t say enough good things about this $T$ .

i do n’t usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but i ’ll come to $T$ anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner .

the $T$ leaves much to be desired , from feeling like you are rushed the place your order , to being ignored the rest of the night .

they are extremely rude , not even apologizing for the horrible $T$ we got and handing us a bill well over $ 500 for some drinks adn their pita bread !
