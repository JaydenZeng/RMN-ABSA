I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small -LRB- especially the appetizers -RRB- , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer -LRB- 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing -RRB- , a $T$ , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .

over the years the host , $T$ , and his crew , have always treated me as family -- although with all the business this not - so - little gem does , it amazing he 's even able to remember a consistent but not - so - frequent visitor .

sometimes tables do n't understand his sense of humor but it 's refreshing to have a $T$ who has personality , professionalism , and respects the privacy of your dinner .

for desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse ( interesting but not extraordinary ) and $T$ , which was phenomenal .
matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake

maybe it was the great company ( i had friends visiting from philly – yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but i just ca n’t say enough good things about this $T$ .

i do n’t usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but i ’ll come to $T$ anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner .

the $T$ leaves much to be desired , from feeling like you are rushed the place your order , to being ignored the rest of the night .
service

they are extremely rude , not even apologizing for the horrible $T$ we got and handing us a bill well over $ 500 for some drinks adn their pita bread !

the $T$ are good , yes , but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich , perfect on its supermarket squishy bun .
